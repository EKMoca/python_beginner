# To what value does the following expression evaluate?
'12' < '9'
# This expression evalutes to True because they are strings and
# string length evaluation is different than calculating integers.
# It evaluates each text byte from left to right and since 9
# is greater than 1, python calculates '9' being greater than '12'.

print('12' < '9')
